This project is a Cortex M4 firmware allowing to demonstrate large data buffer exchange between Cortex-M4 and Cortex-A7 cores, in an application like a LogicAnalyser.
  
This project requires SystemWorkbench IDE.

Please note that Drivers and Middleware are not included in the project; current asumption is that STM32Cube_FW_MP1_V1.2.0RC2 package is located at the same level as the project root folder.

If you don't get STM32Cube_FW_MP1_V1.2.0RC2 package, just rename your package to match the required name.
